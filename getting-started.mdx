— (3) how it works

1. select the layers or frames you want to tidy up.
2. connect an ai provider (paste a free api key or connect to lm studio).
3. click "rename" —the plugin sends the layer structure to the ai, which returns perfectly formatted names based on your settings.

## installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="install from figma community">
    install **layersense** from the figma community.
  </Step>
  <Step title="run the plugin">
    press `cmd + /` (or `ctrl + /` on windows) and type "layersense".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## first run tips

<Warning>
**start small** — try selecting just one frame or a small group of elements to see how the ai interprets them.
</Warning>

– **check your context** — ensure your layers are reasonably structured. the ai works best when it can see the hierarchy (e.g., buttons inside containers).
– **verify the api** — if nothing happens, check the [providers](/providers) guide to ensure your api key is valid.
