— (1) how it works

1. select the layers or frames you want to tidy up
2. connect an ai provider (paste a free api key or connect to lm studio)
3. click the big green circle — the plugin sends the layer structure to the ai, which returns perfectly formatted names based on your settings

the plugin processes layers in batches of 15 with automatic retry logic for rate limits.

— (2) installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="install from figma community">
    search for **layersense** in the figma community and click install.
  </Step>
  <Step title="run the plugin">
    press `cmd + /` (or `ctrl + /` on windows) and type "layersense" to launch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="get your free api key">
    the plugin defaults to cerebras. get your free key at [cloud.cerebras.ai](https://cloud.cerebras.ai) — see the [providers guide](/providers) for step-by-step instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="paste your key and rename">
    click the settings gear, go to the **api** tab, paste your key, then go back and select some layers to rename.
  </Step>
</Steps>

— (3) quick start checklist

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="select layers first" icon="mouse-pointer">
    you must have at least one layer selected before clicking rename. the plugin only renames layers with default figma names like "frame 1", "rectangle 12", "text 5", etc.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="start small" icon="seedling">
    try selecting just one frame or a small group of elements first to see how the ai interprets them. once you're comfortable, select larger sections.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="check your hierarchy" icon="sitemap">
    the ai works best when it can see the hierarchy (e.g., buttons inside containers). well-structured layouts produce better names.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="verify api connection" icon="plug">
    if nothing happens after clicking rename, check the [providers](/providers) guide to ensure your api key is valid and the endpoint is correct.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

— (4) what gets renamed

the plugin identifies and renames layers that:

- have default figma names (frame, group, rectangle, text, ellipse, vector, etc.)
- are visible and unlocked
- are not nested inside component instances (to preserve component structure)

layers with custom names you've already set are skipped.

— (5) troubleshooting

<Warning>
**no layers to rename?** this means all selected layers either already have custom names or are locked/hidden. try selecting a frame that contains default-named children.
</Warning>

| issue | solution |
|-------|----------|
| "select layers to rename" | select at least one layer before clicking the rename button |
| nothing happens | check your api key in settings → api tab |
| rate limit errors | the plugin automatically retries with delays; wait a moment |
| slow response | try a faster model like `gpt-oss-120b` on cerebras or `gemini-2.0-flash` |
| names don't match expectations | adjust focus, verbosity, or add custom rules in settings |
