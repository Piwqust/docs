— how it works

1. select layers to rename
2. connect an ai provider (paste a free api key or use lm studio)
3. click the green circle — ai generates meaningful names based on your settings

— installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="install from figma community">
    search for **layersense** in the figma community and click install.
  </Step>
  <Step title="run the plugin">
    press `cmd + /` (or `ctrl + /` on windows) and type "layersense" to launch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="get your free api key">
    the plugin defaults to cerebras. get your free key at [cloud.cerebras.ai](https://cloud.cerebras.ai) — see the [providers guide](/providers) for step-by-step instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="paste your key and rename">
    click the settings gear, go to the **api** tab, paste your key, then go back and select some layers to rename.
  </Step>
</Steps>

— quick tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="select layers first" icon="mouse-pointer">
    you must have at least one layer selected before clicking rename. the plugin only renames layers with default figma names like "frame 1", "rectangle 12", "text 5", etc.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="start small" icon="seedling">
    try selecting just one frame or a small group of elements first to see how the ai interprets them. once you're comfortable, select larger sections.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="check your hierarchy" icon="sitemap">
    the ai works best when it can see the hierarchy (e.g., buttons inside containers). well-structured layouts produce better names.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="verify api connection" icon="plug">
    if nothing happens after clicking rename, check the [providers](/providers) guide to ensure your api key is valid and the endpoint is correct.
  </Accordion>

— troubleshooting

<Warning>
**no layers to rename?** this means all selected layers either already have custom names or are locked/hidden. try selecting a frame that contains default-named children.
</Warning>

| issue | solution |
|-------|----------|
| "select layers to rename" | select at least one layer before clicking the rename button |
| nothing happens | check your api key in settings → api tab |
| rate limit errors | the plugin automatically retries with delays; wait a moment |
| slow response | try a faster model like `gpt-oss-120b` (3,000+ tok/s), `gemini-2.5-flash`, or `qwen-3-32b` |
| names don't match expectations | adjust focus, verbosity, or add custom rules in settings |
