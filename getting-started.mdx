## How It Works

Simple 3-step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select">
    Choose the layers, frames, or groups you want to tidy up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Set up an AI provider (see [providers](/providers) for free options).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rename">
    Click "Rename" — the plugin sends the layer structure to the AI, which returns perfectly formatted names based on your settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install from Figma Community">
    Install **layersense** from the Figma Community.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the Plugin">
    Press `Cmd + /` (or `Ctrl + /` on Windows) and type "layersense".
  </Step>
</Steps>

## First Run Tips

<Warning>
**Start small** — try selecting just one frame or a small group of elements to see how the AI interprets them.
</Warning>

- **Check your context** — ensure your layers are reasonably structured. The AI works best when it can see the hierarchy (e.g., buttons inside containers).
- **Verify the API** — if nothing happens, check the [providers](/providers) guide to ensure your API key is valid.
