— (2) why i built this

i created this tool because i faced a common frustration: looking for a layer renamer and finding that every good solution was behind a paywall. the few free options available didn't actually use ai and couldn't understand context.

i wanted a tool that puts you in control – allowing you to use your own api keys (including free tiers) or run local llms, ensuring you never have to pay to keep your file organized.

## privacy first

because layersense connects directly to your provider:

– your layer data goes straight from figma to the ai provider
– it **does not** pass through any layersense middleman server
– if you use **local llms**, your design data never leaves your computer

## open source

we believe essential workflow tools shouldn't be gated behind rent-seeking subscriptions.
