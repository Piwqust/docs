— (1) the problem

every designer knows the pain: you're deep in a project, layers piling up, and suddenly you're staring at "frame 427", "rectangle 89", and "group 12". finding anything becomes a nightmare. handoff to developers? good luck explaining what "frame 312" is supposed to be.

existing solutions either:
- cost money every month
- use simple find-and-replace patterns that don't understand context
- require complex setup

— (2) why i built this

i wanted a tool that:
- actually understands what a layer is (not just its type)
- works for free — no subscriptions, no trials, no "free for 10 layers"
- respects privacy — your designs shouldn't go through random servers
- lets you bring your own ai provider

the solution: connect directly to free ai apis like cerebras or google gemini, or run completely offline with local models. you control everything.

— (3) privacy first

layersense connects **directly** to your chosen ai provider:

- your layer data goes straight from figma → ai provider → back to figma
- **no middleman servers** — layersense has no backend
- **nothing is stored** — the plugin doesn't log or save your designs
- **local option** — with lm studio, your data never leaves your computer

this is possible because figma plugins can make direct http requests. we just pass your layer info to the ai api you configure.

— (4) how it stays free

the plugin itself is free. the ai costs are covered by:

- **free api tiers** — cerebras, google gemini, and openrouter offer generous free access
- **your own keys** — if you have openai or anthropic credits, use them
- **local models** — lm studio runs on your hardware with zero cost

there's no catch. no premium tier coming. no "upgrade to rename more than 50 layers".

— (5) open approach

the plugin code runs entirely in your figma client. the settings are stored locally in figma's client storage. the only external calls are the ai api requests you configure.

we believe essential workflow tools shouldn't be gated behind rent-seeking subscriptions. if it helps you work faster, it should just work.

— (6) feedback

found a bug? have a feature idea? use the **feedback** button in the plugin footer. your message is saved locally and helps improve the plugin.
