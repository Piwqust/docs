## The Problem

I created this tool because I faced a common frustration: looking for a layer renamer and finding that every good solution was behind a paywall. The few free options available didn't actually use AI and couldn't understand context.

## The Solution

**You** should be in control.

Instead of charging a subscription fee to resell you OpenAI credits, layersense lets you:

1. **Bring your own key** — use your own API keys
2. **Use free tiers** — take advantage of generous free tiers from Google, Cerebras, and OpenRouter
3. **Go local** — run models on your own hardware for zero cost

## Privacy First

Because layersense connects directly to your provider:

- Your layer data goes straight from Figma to the AI provider
- It **does not** pass through any layersense middleman server
- If you use **local LLMs**, your design data never leaves your computer

## Open Source

We believe essential workflow tools shouldn't be gated behind rent-seeking subscriptions.
