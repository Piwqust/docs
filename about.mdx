— why i built this

— the problem i created this tool because i faced a common frustration: looking for a layer renamer and finding that every good solution was behind a paywall. the few free options available didn't actually use ai and couldn't understand context.

— the solution **you** should be in control.

instead of charging a subscription fee to resell you openai credits, layersense lets you:

1. **bring your own key**: use your own api keys.
2. **use free tiers**: take advantage of generous free tiers from google, cerebras, and openrouter.
3. **go local**: run models on your own hardware for zero cost.

— privacy first because layersense connects directly to your provider: • your layer data goes straight from figma to the ai provider. • it **does not** pass through any layersense middleman server. • if you use **local llms**, your design data never leaves your computer.

— open source we believe essential workflow tools shouldn't be gated behind rent-seeking subscriptions.
