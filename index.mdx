— (1) what it does

stop wasting time manually renaming "frame 45" and "rectangle 12". this plugin uses artificial intelligence to analyze your layers – their visual content, hierarchy, and text – to generate meaningful, semantic names automatically.

the main difference: unlike other plugins that require a paid subscription or rely on simple pattern matching, this plugin is designed to be 100% free to use. it connects to free ai providers (like google gemini or openrouter) or even runs locally on your computer, giving you unlimited renaming power without monthly fees.
