— (1) what it does

stop wasting time manually renaming "frame 45" and "rectangle 12". layersense uses artificial intelligence to analyze your layers — their visual content, hierarchy, and text — to generate meaningful, semantic names automatically.

the main difference: unlike other plugins that require paid subscriptions or rely on simple pattern matching, layersense is designed to be **100% free**. it connects to free ai providers like cerebras or google gemini, or even runs locally on your computer using lm studio, giving you unlimited renaming power without monthly fees.
