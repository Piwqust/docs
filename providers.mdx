— (5) api & provider settings

flexible connection options to suit your budget and privacy needs:

– providers: native support for openai, anthropic (claude), google gemini, openrouter, cerebras, and local llms (via lm studio).
– model selection: manually type any model name (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `qwen-2.5`, `gemini-1.5-flash`).
– temperature: control the "creativity" of the ai (lower is more consistent).
– export/import: save your settings and api configurations to transfer them between files or share with teammates.

— (6) how to run it for free

you don't need a credit card. here is where to get free access:

– google gemini: get a free api key with generous limits at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/)
– openrouter: access free models (like mistral or llama) at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
– cerebras: offers an incredibly fast free tier at [cloud.cerebras.ai](https://cloud.cerebras.ai/)
– lm studio (local): download [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/) to run models offline on your own gpu (zero limits, total privacy).

(note: free api tiers may have rate limits depending on the provider).
