— detailed features & settings

access these options by clicking the **settings (⚙)** toggle.

— prompt settings tailor exactly how the ai names your layers:

• **output language**: – `auto`: detects language based on content. – `en`: forces english names (recommended). – `ru`: forces russian names.

• **style**: – `Title Case` (e.g., "Submit Button") – `camelCase` (e.g., "submitButton") – `kebab-case` (e.g., "submit-button") – `snake_case` (e.g., "submit_button") – `flatcase` (e.g., "submitbutton")

• **word count**: set a constraint range (e.g., **2-4 words**) to keep names concise or descriptive.

— focus strategy tell the ai what is most important:

• **function**: names based on what the element _does_ (e.g., `SubmitButton`). best for interactive components. • **content**: names based on the _text_ or image inside (e.g., `StartFreeTrialLabel`). best for text layers. • **context**: names based on the _location_ in the layout (e.g., `HeaderContainer`). best for layout frames.

— advanced controls

• **detail level**: switch between **minimal** (short), **descriptive**, or **detailed** (verbose) naming. • **parent context**: when enabled, the ai looks at parent layers to understand where the element lives. crucial for nested auto layouts.

— custom rules ("god mode") type natural language instructions to the ai.

examples: • "always add a 'btn-' prefix to interactive elements." • "never use the word 'frame' or 'group'." • "if a layer contains an icon, end the name with '\_icon'." • "translate all text content to spanish."

— utilities

• **statistics**: track how many layers you've successfully renamed. • **developer mode**: enables detailed error logging. • **batch processing**: processes layers in batches of 15 to avoid rate limits.
