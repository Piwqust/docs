Access these options by clicking the **Settings (⚙)** toggle.

## Prompt Settings

Tailor exactly how the AI names your layers:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Output Language">
    - `auto` — detects language based on content
    - `en` — forces English names (recommended)
    - `ru` — forces Russian names
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Naming Style">
    - `Title Case` (e.g., "Submit Button")
    - `camelCase` (e.g., "submitButton")
    - `kebab-case` (e.g., "submit-button")
    - `snake_case` (e.g., "submit_button")
    - `flatcase` (e.g., "submitbutton")
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Word Count">
    Set a constraint range (e.g., **2-4 words**) to keep names concise or descriptive.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Focus Strategy

Tell the AI what is most important:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Function" icon="bolt">
    Names based on what the element *does* (e.g., `SubmitButton`). Best for interactive components.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content" icon="text">
    Names based on the *text* or image inside (e.g., `StartFreeTrialLabel`). Best for text layers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context" icon="layer-group">
    Names based on the *location* in the layout (e.g., `HeaderContainer`). Best for layout frames.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Advanced Controls

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Detail Level** | Switch between **minimal** (short), **descriptive**, or **detailed** (verbose) naming |
| **Parent Context** | When enabled, the AI looks at parent layers to understand where the element lives. Crucial for nested auto layouts |

## Custom Rules ("God Mode")

Type natural language instructions to the AI.

<Tip>
**Examples:**
- "Always add a 'btn-' prefix to interactive elements."
- "Never use the word 'frame' or 'group'."
- "If a layer contains an icon, end the name with '_icon'."
- "Translate all text content to Spanish."
</Tip>

## Utilities

- **Statistics** — track how many layers you've successfully renamed
- **Developer Mode** — enables detailed error logging
- **Batch Processing** — processes layers in batches of 15 to avoid rate limits
