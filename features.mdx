control how the ai generates names:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="context" icon="file-lines">
    describe your project or the selected frames. example: "e-commerce checkout flow" or "mobile banking app". this helps the ai understand the purpose of your layers.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="output language" icon="language">
    - **en** — names in english
    - **ru** — names in russian (кириллица)
    - **auto** — ai detects from text content
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="naming style" icon="text-size">
    choose the format for generated names:
    - **title case** — "User Profile Header"
    - **camelcase** — "userProfileHeader"
    - **kebab-case** — "user-profile-header"
    - **snake_case** — "user_profile_header"
    - **flatcase** — "userprofileheader"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="word count" icon="arrows-left-right">
    set minimum and maximum words per name (e.g., 2–4). keeps names concise or allows more detail.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="focus" icon="crosshairs">
    - **function** — names based on what the element does (e.g., "submit button")
    - **content** — names based on text inside (e.g., "start free trial label")
    - **context** — names based on location in layout (e.g., "header container")
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="detail level" icon="sliders">
    - **short** — minimal, concise names
    - **medium** — clear descriptive names
    - **long** — comprehensive names with full context
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="include parent context" icon="sitemap">
    when enabled, the ai considers parent layer names to understand where the element lives. useful for nested auto-layouts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="custom rules" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    your personal naming instructions. examples:
    - "always add 'btn-' prefix to buttons"
    - "don't use the word 'frame'"
    - "use abbreviations for common terms"
    
    the ai follows these rules when generating names.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
