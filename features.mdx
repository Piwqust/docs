— (4) detailed features & settings

access these options by clicking the **settings (⚙)** toggle.

## prompt settings

– tailor exactly how the ai names your layers:
  - output language: force names in `en` (english), `ru` (russian), or let it detect automatically (`auto`).
  - style: enforce code standards like `camelCase`, `kebab-case`, `snake_case`, or standard `Title Case`.
  - word count: set a constraint range (e.g., "2-4 words") to keep names concise or descriptive.

– focus strategy:
  - function: names based on what the element *does* (e.g., "submitbutton").
  - content: names based on the text inside (e.g., "startfreetriallabel").
  - context: names based on the location in the layout (e.g., "headercontainer").

– detail level: switch between **minimal** (short), **descriptive**, or **detailed** (verbose) naming.

– parent context: when enabled, the ai looks at the parent layers to understand where the element lives (crucial for nested auto-layouts).

– custom rules: the "god mode" for naming. type instructions like "always add 'btn-' prefix to buttons" or "don't use the word 'frame'", and the ai will obey.

## utilities

– **statistics** — track how many layers you've successfully renamed
– **developer mode** — enables detailed error logging
– **batch processing** — processes layers in batches of 15 to avoid rate limits
